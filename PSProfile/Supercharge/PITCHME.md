### ü§î What is PSProfile?

PSProfile is a module enabling easy PowerShell @css[text-code](`$profile`) management. It is built to be a single-pane-of-glass to your full @css[text-code](`$profile`) as well as providing some productivity boosting features.

---

### üí™Goals of the module

PSProfile is designed to...

---

#### Minimize actual @css[text-code](`$profile`) contents...

@snap[text-07]
Your @css[text-code](`$profile`) can be reduced down to one line:<br/>@css[text-code](`Import-Module PSProfile`)
@snapend

#### Enable managing your @css[text-code](`$profile`) from a single location...

@snap[text-08]
Everything is stored on a single configuration file!

---

#### Be portable...
@snap[text-08]
With `Export-PSProfileConfiguration` and `Export-PSProfileConfiguration`, migrating your `$profile` from one machine to the next is a breeze.
@snapend

---

#### Be extensible...

@snap[text-08]
PSProfile includes support for custom plugins. Plugins can be designed as a simple script or a full module and installed from the PowerShell Gallery or local file path.

#### Provide quality-of-life improvements

@snap[text-07]
PSProfile includes a number of functions built with PowerShell development in mind:
@ul
- Project folder aliasing and argument completion
    - Quickly move between your Git repo folders by name with Git project tab-completion
- `Open-Code`
    - Designed to wrap the `code` CLI and provide additional functionality.
- `Start-BuildScript` (a.k.a. `bld`)
    - Easily launch a `build.ps1` script from anywhere in a sub-process.
- `Enter-CleanEnvironment` (a.k.a. `cln`)
    - Opens a clean child process with `-NoProfile` and some `PSReadline` settings added for convenience.
